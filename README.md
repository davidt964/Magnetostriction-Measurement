# Magnetostriction-Measurement
The software that performed the magnetic field sweep and data processing are provided in this repository. This code provides the data for the article we authored with several other contributors: 
"Cost-Effective Measurement of Magnetostriction in Nanoscale Thin Films Through an Optical Cantilever Displacement Method."

Feel free to use and modify this code for whatever purposes you wish provided that it is not-for-profit and this repository is cited. Thank you!
