# Magnetostriction-Measurement
Code that performed the magnetic field sweep and data processing are provided in this repository. This code provides the data for the paper we authored: 
"Cost-Effective Measurement of Magnetostriction in Nanoscale Thin Films Through an Optical Cantilever Displacement Method."

Feel free to use this code for whatever purposes you wish provided that it is not-for-profit and this repository is cited. Thank you!
